TODO for JSDoc

- package naming (maybe syntax-highlighted source view too?)

- /* blah */ still can be in a paramter list in the docs
 
- support for a time stamp

- Some of the ->{vars} are set to undef, should be an empty map

- Clean up the static, private and final markers (spacing)

- Make static/final/etc line up on one line with non-breaking spaces

- Make jsdoc.pl easily runnable from anywhere without having to install
JSDoc.pm in the @INC

- Add an @extends construct

- Make handling of @attributes consistent all over (@param and @return are 
handled by parser, others are handled in jsdoc.pl)

- Fix bug where {@link whatever} doesn't work for inner functions

- Add command line params --quiet, --dump-tree

- Add command line param --stylesheet

- Make navbar links selective so they are never broken

- Add in support for more javadoc @attributes (in the maps) 

- Update the help doc
