README for jsdoc.pl

jsdoc.pl is a script that produces javadoc-style documentation from well-formed 
JavaScript sourcefiles. At the moment, this means it supports sourcefiles where 
all functions are mapped to a class using prototype-based inheritance. 
Anonymous function definitions 
(e.g. Circle.prototype.getRadius = function(){ ...} ) are supported.

Please see http://jsdoc.sourceforge.net for examples of appropriate 
documentation style.

All functions that are not mapped in a class in any way are mapped to a
pseudo-class called '[default context]'. 

For classes where properties and methods are assigned within the constructor,
the corresponding constructor should be marked with the standalone 
'@constructor' tag. This tells the JSDoc parser to look inside the 
definition of this function (constructor) and map methods and properties that 
it finds there.

This application requires Perl5, as well as two additional addon modules:
    - HTML::Template, which is available from CPAN (cpan.org)
    - JSDoc.pm, which is available from the jsdoc sourceforge project 
	(sourceforge.net/projects/jsdoc)

Invocation is simple: Just run the application, giving one or more well-formed 
OO JavaScript sourcefilename(s) as arguments. A sample JS sourcefile, test.js, 
is given along with this application. An example of running the application is 
shown below:

    $ ./jsdoc.pl test.js

OR
    perl jsdoc.pl test.js

If there are any questions, comments, problems or anything else, please 
contact Gabriel Reid (gab_reid@users.sourceforge.net). This application has 
been successfully tested on Linux (Debian and Redhat), Mac OS X, and 
Windows 2000 with ActivePerl.
